| Game Utilities (for Black Jack game) |
 ======================================

This is the game utility library I created for my Black Jack game. If you're interested, 
check out my Black Jack repo. If you want to compile the game, you'll need to clone both
repos and set the Black Jack project to link in the game utilities lib, as well as get 
your hands on the following dx9 dlls, which game utilities is dependent on:

d3d9.lib
d3dx9.lib
dinput8.lib
dxguid.lib
